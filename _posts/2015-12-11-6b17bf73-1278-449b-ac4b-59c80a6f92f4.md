The Fury.  An Imperial-Class Star Destroyer that has been in service for three years.  It is my new home.  I am honored to be a part of this massive military vessel.  I can feel the power of the Emperor himself propelling this ship into the distant expanse of space.  We will bring peace to this galaxy.  One system at a time.
